--------- START PRINTING SIMULATION STATISTICS -----------

Simulation characteristics: We are simulating deadlock detection - banker's algorithm run every 5 times to detect!
For process 0, number of process created, killed and completed are 4, 2 and 1 respectively
For process 1, number of process created, killed and completed are 2, 1 and 0 respectively
For process 2, number of process created, killed and completed are 3, 2 and 0 respectively
For process 3, number of process created, killed and completed are 4, 2 and 1 respectively

For the simulation, total processes created, killed and completed are 13, 7 and 2 respectively
Ratio of processes completed to created is 0.153846
Ratio of processes killed to created is 0.538462

For the simulation, total turnaround time and execution time for all the process instances completed are 27 and 22 respectively
Ratio of total execution to turnaround is 0.814815
Throughput of the simulation with processes completed 2 and simulation time 50 is 25.000000
