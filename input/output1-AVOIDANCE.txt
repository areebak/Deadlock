For process 2, number of process created, killed and completed are 4, 2 and 2 respectively
For process 3, number of process created, killed and completed are 7, 3 and 3 respectively

For the simulation, total processes created, killed and completed are 21, 9 and 9 respectively
Ratio of processes completed to created is 0.428571
Ratio of processes killed to created is 0.428571

For the simulation, total turnaround time and execution time for all the process instances completed are 170 and 54 respectively
Ratio of total execution to turnaround is 0.317647
Throughput of the simulation with processes completed 9 and simulation time 50 is 5.555556
