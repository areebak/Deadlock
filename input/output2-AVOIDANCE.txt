For process 1, number of process created, killed and completed are 5, 1 and 3 respectively
For process 2, number of process created, killed and completed are 3, 0 and 2 respectively
For process 3, number of process created, killed and completed are 3, 0 and 2 respectively
For process 4, number of process created, killed and completed are 5, 2 and 3 respectively

For the simulation, total processes created, killed and completed are 24, 7 and 13 respectively
Ratio of processes completed to created is 0.541667
Ratio of processes killed to created is 0.291667

For the simulation, total turnaround time and execution time for all the process instances completed are 222 and 52 respectively
Ratio of total execution to turnaround is 0.234234
Throughput of the simulation with processes completed 13 and simulation time 50 is 3.846154
