--------- START PRINTING SIMULATION STATISTICS -----------

Simulation characteristics: We are simulating deadlock avoidance.
For process 0, number of process created, killed and completed are 2, 0 and 1 respectively
For process 1, number of process created, killed and completed are 1, 0 and 0 respectively
For process 2, number of process created, killed and completed are 1, 0 and 1 respectively
For process 3, number of process created, killed and completed are 2, 0 and 1 respectively
For process 4, number of process created, killed and completed are 2, 0 and 1 respectively

For the simulation, total processes created, killed and completed are 8, 0 and 4 respectively
Ratio of processes completed to created is 0.500000
Ratio of processes killed to created is 0.000000

For the simulation, total turnaround time and execution time for all the process instances completed are 54 and 43 respectively
Ratio of total execution to turnaround is 0.796296
Throughput of the simulation with processes completed 4 and simulation time 20 is 5.000000
