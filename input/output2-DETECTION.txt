Simulation characteristics: We are simulating deadlock detection - banker's algorithm run every 5 times to detect!
For process 0, number of process created, killed and completed are 8, 4 and 3 respectively
For process 1, number of process created, killed and completed are 4, 1 and 2 respectively
For process 2, number of process created, killed and completed are 2, 0 and 2 respectively
For process 3, number of process created, killed and completed are 2, 0 and 2 respectively
For process 4, number of process created, killed and completed are 5, 2 and 2 respectively

For the simulation, total processes created, killed and completed are 21, 7 and 11 respectively
Ratio of processes completed to created is 0.523810
Ratio of processes killed to created is 0.333333

For the simulation, total turnaround time and execution time for all the process instances completed are 238 and 51 respectively
Ratio of total execution to turnaround is 0.214286
Throughput of the simulation with processes completed 11 and simulation time 50 is 4.545455
